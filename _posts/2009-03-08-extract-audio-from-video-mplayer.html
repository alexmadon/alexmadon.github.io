Extracting sound from a video, and save it as Mp3

ffmpeg -i source_video.avi -vn -ar 44100 -ac 2 -ab 192 -f mp3 sound.mp3


==============
How to Convert a Flash Video File (.flv) to MP4 with FFMpeg
convert a FLV to a MP4

 ffmpeg -i votretoasttoreadorsongdmitrihvorostovsky__oqen57tva1s___youtube_.flv  -ar 22050 votretoasttoreadorsongdmitrihvorostovsky.mp4

This basically says "Using ffmpeg, take the file FILE_NAME.flv, change the sample rate (this is the -ar 22050 part, and it makes a world of difference to the audio quality), and output a file called NEW_FILE_NAME in the mp4 format."

============



You can easily extract audio from video files such as avi, mpg, even flv! into mp3 
uses either mplayer or ffmpeg. You can even record online stream into mp3, such as stream from radio cast.

Lets begin with mplayer. To extract audio from video files, use -dumpaudio option and specified the output filename with -dumpfile

mplayer -dumpaudio nodame_theme.flv -dumpfile nodame_theme.mp3
