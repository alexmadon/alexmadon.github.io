Majorcan veggie bake
http://www.waitrose.com/recipe/Majorcan_veggie_bake.aspx

    * Vegetarian

Preparation time :  10 minutes
Cooking time :  45 minutes to 50 minutes
Total time :  55 minutes to 1 hour

Serves: Serves 4 as a main course or 6 as a side dish
Ingredients

<ul>
<li>400g tin essential Waitrose Chopped Tomatoes
<li>1 tbsp chopped fresh oregano
<li>2 Cloves garlic, chopped
<li>2 tbsp Olive oil
<li>1 Medium aubergine, sliced
<li>1 essential Waitrose Red Pepper, halved, deseeded and sliced
<li>1 medium essential Waitrose Onion, sliced
<li>650g essential Waitrose Estima or Maris Piper potatoes, peeled and sliced
</ul>
Method


<ol>
  <li> Preheat the oven to 200ºC, gas mark 6. In a pan combine the chopped tomatoes, oregano, garlic and 1 tsp of the oil, season and simmer over a medium heat for 10 minutes until thickened, stirring occasionally.
   <li>   Meanwhile, toss the aubergine, pepper and onion in the remaining oil and season. Arrange over the base of a roasting tin and cook in the oven for 10 minutes. In a 2 litre ovenproof dish, layer up the roasted vegetables with the sliced potatoes and tomato sauce, seasoning each layer. Finish with a layer of potatoes, and then tomato sauce. Cover with kitchen foil.
   <li>   Bake for 45–50 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the top is golden, removing the kitchen foil half way through cooking. Leave to stand for 5 minutes for the flavours to settle before serving with crusty bread and a salad.
</ol>

Drinks recommendation

This flavoursome tomate-based, rustic bake is perfectly suited to a juicy yet full-bodied Italian red such as the Poggiotondo, Cerro del Masso 2006 Chianti, Tuscany, Italy, also suitable for vegetarians.
Gourmet secret

Tumbet is the Majorcan name for this dish.
