Launch Timidity as a daemon before launching Rosegarden :<br />
<br />
$ timidity -iA<br />
<br />
or fluidsynth that support pulse audio<br />
<br />
freepats<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Does it have to be timidity? I've made pretty good experiences with fluidsynth personally which has a native pulse backend, only thing you have to make sure is to modprobe snd_seq somewhere beforehand, and either set up the systemd service as an user service or simply start it manually with normal user rights, worked pretty flawlessly when I tried in wine but I don't have that game anymore I used to play with so I can't really test<br />
