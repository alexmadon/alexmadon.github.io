My Skype is working almost completely. I can send files, make and receive calls and chats normally. However, I don't receive messages from chat groups that have been created recently.<br />
<br />
What I have tried:<br />
<br />
    remove my ~/.Skype folder;<br />
    reinstall another version from ubuntu repositories (32 and 64 bits);<br />
    firewall rules;<br />
    proxy is fine as other users are successfully talking.<br />
<br />
I am on Ubuntu 14.04 64 bits and Skype 4.3.0.37-1 32 bits but this problem seems to happen even on Windows (here and here)<br />
<br />
It seems to be related to cloud group chats.<br />
<br />
I don't receive messages from groups whose name starts with "19:xxxx". However I receive from groups whose name starts with $ or something else.<br />
<br />
The following command returns the group name:<br />
<br />
/get name<br />
<br />
<br />

 <br />
<br />
I will answer my own question... I hope this will help someone! :)<br />
<br />
After struggling a bit, I found some useful commands:<br />
<br />
    /dumpmsnp - show details about your connection<br />
    /showplaces - show where you are currently connected<br />
<br />
You can execute them in any chat window.<br />
<br />
/dumpmsnp command was showing "LoggedOut", but I was online and talking almost normally (except group chats).<br />
<br />
System: MSNP: Connection Data:<br />
 * Status: LoggedOut<br />
<br />
A lot of people are/were suffering from this problem (here).<br />
<br />
To solve this "LoggedOut" issue, try this on any chat window:<br />
<br />
/msnp24<br />
<br />
and restart your Skype.<br />
<br />
After restarting, /dumpmsnp output shows the following status:<br />
<br />
System: MSNP: Connection Data (MSNP24):<br />
 * Status: LoggedIn<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly why, but the /msnp24 command kinds of converted my account to this protocol and now everything works perfectly.<br />
<br />
I've found the solution here.<br />
