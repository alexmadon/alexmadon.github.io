What is a collection?
<br>
MonadicDesignPatternsForTheWeb.pdf
<br>
The fact is these are just two syntaxes for one
underlying language for denoting collections
<br>
In maths:
<pre>
{ x in D | C1(x), C2(x), ..., Cn(x) }
</pre>

In SQL:
<pre>
select x from D where C1(x) and ... and Cn(x)
</pre>

In scala
<pre>
for( x <- D if C1(x) && ... && Cn( x ) ) yield x
</pre>


Example:
<pre>
scala> for (i <- List.range(1,10)) yield i*2 
res7: List[Int] = List(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18)
</pre>

A higher order function is a function that takes a function as a parameter or returns a function as a result. <b>Monads are containers which have several higher order functions defined.</b> Or, since we're talking about Scala, monads have several higher order methods. One such method is <b>map</b>.
