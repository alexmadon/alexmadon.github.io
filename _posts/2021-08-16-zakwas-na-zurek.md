 How much Rye Starter do I need for a soup?

The more ‘zakwas’ you add, the sourer the soup will be. For 1 litre (approx. 1 lq quart) of a ready Żurek:

    You’ll need from 150 ml (10 tbsp) for a mildly sour flavour, 
    up to 250 ml (1 cup) for a ‘properly’ sour soup. Or more, just taste and adjust.
