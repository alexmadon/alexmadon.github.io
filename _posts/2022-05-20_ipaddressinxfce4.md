# Show IP address in Xfce bar

Hey folks!
https://www.reddit.com/r/xfce/comments/b4i7uf/show_ip_address_in_xfce_bar/

I'm currently struggling to get a simple thing working: I just want my IP address to be shown in plain text in my Xfce bar.

Is there an addon available for that? I guess it just needs to know which network device I'm talking about and the seconds how often it should refresh.


Try xfce4-genmon-plugin with command curl ifconfig.co
