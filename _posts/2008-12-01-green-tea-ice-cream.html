Item Description

100g of Matcha tea in a silver tin with re-attachable plastic seal. Matcha is ground green tea. Steamed, cooled and dried green tea leaves are sorted into stems and leaves. The stems and veins are sorted out to leave the most tender part of the leaf - Tencha. The Tencha is then ground down to make 'Matcha'. It is a delicate process that takes a considerable amount of time. It is matcha tea that is used in the Japanese Tea Ceremony, and the best matcha is some of the most expensive tea in the world. Like other teas it is rich in antioxidants called polyphenols. These help prevent cancer, keep the heart healthy and aid general well-being.
