UnsatisfiableError: The following specifications were found
to be incompatible with the existing python installation in your environment:

Specifications:

									- spleeter -> python[version='>=3.6,&lt;3.7.0a0|>=3.7,&lt;3.8.0a0']

Your python: python=3.8

If python is on the left-most side of the chain, that's the version you've asked for.
When python appears to the right, that indicates that the thing on the left is somehow
not available for the python version you are constrained to. Note that conda will not
change your python version to a different minor version unless you explicitly specify
that.
```



From Anaconda site : article on 2020.02 release explains: "As there are still some key OSS projects that aren’t available or stable for Python 3.8, the installers are based around Python 3.7. Notably, at the time of this release, Tensorflow does not yet support Python 3.8, so installers based around Python 3.8 would cause problems for users who want to use Tensorflow. There are Python 3.6 and Python 3.8 metapackages available with this release, so you can work with Anaconda in other versions of Python as you wish." source: anaconda.com/anaconda-individual-edition-2020-02 – Adrian Mar 14 at 15:28
