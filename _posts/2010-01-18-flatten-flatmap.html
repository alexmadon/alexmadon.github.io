Use flatten from the List singleton object, which doesn't require that implicit parameter:

<pre>
scala> val foo = List(List(1), List("a","b","c"), List(2.3))
foo: List[List[Any]] = List(List(1), List(a, b, c), List(2.3))

scala> List.flatten(foo)
res7: List[Any] = List(1, a, b, c, 2.3)
</pre>

flatten(list) is equivalent to list flatMap (x => x). Furthermore, this should hold for more than just list, but for other type constructors too (sadly, Option is missing a flatten function: Option[Option[A]] => Option[A]). This is a special relationship that all monads have (join is a synonym for flatten and bind is a synonym for flatMap):
