<h2> Shapes Example </h2>
OOP versus Procedural/Relational
<br>
using XBase and L Code and Examples, <br>and
<b>Case Statement</b> Analysis


<a href="http://w3.one.net/~jweirich/oostuff/">
Jim Weirich has a webpage</a> 
where several implementations of 
a version of the classic OOP shape example are supplied.  I have
presented an XBase version <a href="#code">below</a>.
(XBase is derived from dBASE III+ and "clone" dialects of
this once popular desktop and LAN relational database system.)
<p>
The XBase version stores the shape data in a table
rather than just RAM (memory). <b> This is much more
typical of business applications.</b>
It also highlights some
of the base assumptions behind Object Oriented Programming
with regard to real-world projects.

<blockquote>
Note that shapes are not very representative of <b>real world</b>
needs in general business programming partly due to the
subject matter and partly because geometry is quite
<b>static</b> compared to business rules. However, we are looking
at the shape example because of it's familiarity to
students of OO. In general, I do
<a href="meyer1.htm#casereal">not find</a>
the need to have large repeated
lists of case statements very often in my procedural/relational code;
thus, this debate is mostly academic. However, some of the
philosophical issues that appear here resurface in other debates.
Large and repeated case lists are often a sign that a table should
be used to control the "feature selection" of the variations
instead of case lists.
OO books greatly exaggerate "case proliferation".
</blockquote>

Jim's C++ example assumes that the shape instances are
<b>born and die in memory.</b> However, most dynamic information
(data) of the world is stored in RDBMS's (relational tables).
An OO fan can argue that it belongs in OODBMS's (OO databases), but
that is another topic. For now, they must accept the fact
that it's mostly in RDBMS's for now and the near future.
<p>
The OOP version could map it's structures to an
RDBMS, but mapping is an extra layer to add to
the program.
<p>
Our relational version (XBase in this case) is certainly
not more overall code than the C++ version. So, what
are the differences? For one, the XBase version uses
<a href="cntrl1.htm#theory">SIMPO</a> orientation
(case/switch statements) instead of the SOMPI
(by subclass) of the C++ version. (Don't worry
about the strange terms; we will illustrate
them with code examples below.)
<p>
Case statements are considered to be a 
<a href="oopbad.htm#splitends">great evil</a>
in the church of OOP.  One of the reasons stated for this
is that in OOP, dispatching data to the "proper" method/function
 is done "automatically", and thus does not
need case statements.


The use of the term "automatic" by OO fans is a bit
misleading. The OO approach is simply a 2-step 
process where in p/r it is a one-step process.
OO first assigns something to a "type". The
behavior is then "inherited" in a way 
by being a member of that type.
(One disadvantage of being type-tied is that
if typing {is-a} turns out to be the wrong
modeling approach, then you have a lot of
changing to do. P/r slides from is-a to has-a
much smoother for the most part.)
Comparing the
approaches of the 2 paradigms is like comparing
apples to oranges and gets into some messy
philosophical and linguistic battles.
Thus, rather than get pedantic
about the term "automatic", I find it much more
useful to focus on the total effort to set up
and manage the related structures. As a general
rule, whenever software engineering debates get
bogged down in terminology and classifications,
it is best to change focus to measuring effort
and results. Another related and equally messy
debate issue is whether one approach is
faster than the other as far as CPU usage.
This often relates to whether compile-time
binding or weak binding is used. More on
dispatching is discussed below.


However, this "automatic" dispatch does <b>not</b>
make OOP programs shorter, nor necessarily better
organized. This is essentially because the 
<a href="goals.htm#proximity">proximity</a>
structure
of the relationship between methods and subclasses
(shapes) has been inverted. A negative photographic
image takes up just as much information as the 
positive. It is just an inverted version of the same
thing:
<pre>
<b>OOPish:</b>

  Circle
     Draw
     Move
     Rotate
  Rectangle
     Draw
     Move
     Rotate
  Polygon
     Draw
     Move
     Rotate

<b>Procedural:</b>

  Draw
     Circle
     Rectangle
     Polygon
  Move
     Circle
     Rectangle
     Polygon
  Rotate
     Circle
     Rectangle
     Polygon
</pre>
(We added some methods not in the original
for illustration purposes.)
<p>
As you can see, both types of organizations
take up roughly the same amount of code.
<p>
With the procedural/relational approach, the case
statements serve as sort of "dividers" and are
roughly equivalent to, or at least take the
same space as, OOP method headers.
<p>

OOP programs can actually be longer if they are
getting information from an RDBMS. This is because
they need to map from the table into memory variables.
This mapping will require a case (switch) statement or something
equivalent even though one is using OOP. Thus, even
OOP cannot always escape case statements. Especially
when dealing with outside information.
<p>

<a name="proximity"></a>
<p>
<h3> Proximity Explored </h3>

So, the procedural/relational approach is <b>not</b> more
code. But, what about grouping? Does it have
inferior grouping of stuff? Most methods
related to a subclass (shape) are stored together in OOP.
For example, the Draw method for circles and 
the Moveto method for circles are together in
one place.
<p>
The reasoning goes that if you add a new shape
to the program, then you only have to make
additions to one spot in OOP. Adding a new
shape type, say ellipse, will only require the creation
of one subclass from start to end:
<pre>
  Subclass ellipse {
     ...
     method draw(...) {...}
     method move(...) {...}
     method rotate(...) {...}
  }  
</pre>

However, what if you have to add a new procedure (method)?
Suppose we wanted to add a FindCenter method/function
to each and every shape?
In this case the procedural approach requires less "jumping
around," because you only have to visit <b>one</b> procedure
(the new one, "FindCenter()").
However, adding a new method may require
visiting <b>every</b> shape subclass in the OOP program.
(Inheritance is discussed later.)
You would have to hop around from shape type to shape type.
It would be like having to visit every house on the block in
order to add a new function to their phones.
<p>
Thus, which paradigm requires the least jumping around
depends on the type of addition or maintenance needed.
Neither paradigm
has a monopoly. A tradeoff is forced upon the developer.
<p>
Some OOP developers claim that adding new subclasses is
more common that adding new methods/operations. If such
additions are quite frequent, then perhaps they should be put
into a table and have an input form so that the programmer
is not burdened with frequent additions. (This is obviously
would not work for shape types.)
<p>
One thing I have noticed is that new subclasses (or their procedural
equivalent) are rarely coded in isolation. In other words, the programmer
does not just sit down and code the new shape type from start to finish.
They usually want to see how the <b>other shapes</b>
implemented related operations.
<p>
OOP tends to force related methods <b>apart</b>, and thus isolates them.
This is a feature of OOP that I don't like. (Sure, multi-windowed code 
viewers can help, but they can also be used in procedural programs
to help with their proximity weaknesses as well.)
<p>
Also, in procedural programming, procedures related to a given
procedure tend to be nearby the procedure. Thus, information about
implementing a procedure is all in one place, and this is good. Example:
<pre>
  Routine Draw(shape)      // (procedural pseudo-code)
     select on shape.typeField
     case rectangle
        penDown(topX, leftY)
        movePen(topX, rightY)
        movePen(bottomX, rightY)
        movePen(bottomX, leftY)
        penUp
     case polygon
        penDown(nodeX[1], nodeY[1])
        for i = 2 to shape.nodeCount    // "nodeCount" is a field.
           movePen(nodeX[i], nodeY[i])  // Arrays shown here, but 
        end for                         // could also be tabled
        penUp
     case ellipse
        // to be inserted. See discussion.
  End Routine
  Routine penDown(...)
     ...
  End Routine
  Routine movePen(...)
     ...
  End Routine
</pre>
Now, if we had to add a new shape to Draw(), such as Ellipse, we could
see how the <b>other</b> shapes implemented Draw. We can
also see drawing-related routines nearby, such as PenDown(), MovePen(),
etc. (We will call these "utility" routines.)
<p>
This helps us implement Draw() for new shapes because 
we can learn from the other shapes' implementations and can also
readily review the other drawing-related utility operations, which are
likely to be nearby.
<p>
For example, inspecting the drawing code for Rectangle and
Polygon we see a pattern of "<tt>penDown(), movePen()...movePen(),
penUp()</tt>" for both shape types. This acts as a guide or
template to implement new shapes. (The new ones might not
always use that pattern, but it helps us to see if we are
on track by <b>comparing</b>.)
<p>
Using the OOP approach would not make it easy to see how similar
shapes implemented Draw() because they would be well-separated from
each other. Because you could only see one shape type at a time (without
extra effort), you might not notice the "pen" pattern we just
described, due to the fact that they are not adjacent.
It is much tougher to see
patterns unless related things are <b>next to each other</b>.
One might also <b>miss</b> some good factoring opportunities.


  Below we described how one may view and/or implement
  an ellipse as nothing more than a rectangle with a
  100 percent smoothing factor. Viewing the implementation
  of each subtype in isolation may cause a programmer to
  miss this simplification trick.
  (Note that a smoothed rectangle is probably not the most
  efficient implementation, but often times in one-off business
  dynamic applications, simpler code is more important than
  CPU usage.)


Also, there is no way to put PenDown() and MovePen() near
where they are likely to be used because there is no "near"; It's callers
are scattered about in different OO subclasses.
<b>OOP sacrifices the convenient
gathering of draw-related stuff all in one place that procedural
orientation gives us.</b>
<p>
Many OOP books fail to point out this important proximity loss for some
unknown reason. They only describe the pro-OOP side of the tradeoffs.
OOP's grouping by subclass has its set of advantages,
but there is a clear and nasty tradeoff.
(Note that <a href="cntrl1.htm">Control Tables</a>
attempt to eliminate
making such proximity tradeoffs by taking advantage of a table's
2nd dimension.)
<p>
In OO it is often said that "nouns handle themselves".
Well, in procedural code often the "verbs handle themselves".
Nouns are no more important than verbs. Yes, they are very different
<a href="aspects.htm">aspects</a> of software modeling,
but they are both important.
<p>

<a name="bigot"></a>
<h3> Case Bigotry? </h3>

Even though the case statement version is not more code and not
necessarily better proximity, some OO fans who have viewed
this example have very strange and vague complaints about
using case statements for this purpose.
<p>
Some of these complaints seem to be based on unpleasant
experiences with case statements from specific languages.
There are many variations and approaches to case statements
out there. Please don't dismiss case statements based on
a specific syntax or implementation of them. They vary
widely. (XBase case statements are probably <b>not</b> the
best representation around. Visual Basic has a fairly
nice case statement, although it is a little wordy.)
<p>
Also see
<a href="miscoop.htm#blocks">Block Discrimination</a>.
<p>

&nbsp;<br>

<a name="polymorphism"></a>
<h3> What About Polymorphism? </h3>

Our XBase example has polymorphism, just like
the C++ example. In the example, the instance
type is kept in the table. Thus, OOP has no
monopoly on polymorphism. It only has a monopoly
on getting famous for it.
<p>
Note that some have complained that this XBase version
is not really polymorphism for various, but somewhat
vague reasons. There seem to be many variations of
definitions floating around. This article views
polymorphism as being able to hand-off various items
to another entity and get a result corresponding
to a given name or description regardless of the
type of item handed over. In other words, the
user (including component user) should not have
to explicitly pre-sort or pre-label items based
on their type or nature in order to use a
"polymorphic" operation.
<p>
Even if my example does not qualify under somebody
else's definition of polymorphism, my main focus
will remain on what is the best way to do something
based on the circumstances, not what it is called.
Some OO-fans get too caught up in definitions
and lose sight of more practical concerns. In other
words, worry about whether something is good
<b>before</b> worrying about what <b>name</b> to
assign to it.


<a name="inheritance"></a>
<h3> Inheritance </h3>

Somebody pointed out that inheritance often makes
OO code smaller, because the implementation is
obtained from the parent.
<p>
However, the case statement equivalent also makes
the code smaller. For single-level inheritance,
a default is "fallen into". This is very analogous
to letting an OO parent implement a method if
nothing is stated in the subclass. Both are a kind of
"programming by silence".
(If an implementation is required,
then the case default is often an error message. It
depends on the circumstances.)
<p>
The Equivalent of multi-layer inheritance is done
by listing multiple subtypes on a given case line.
(Not all languages support this feature.)

<blockquote><small>
The case approach has the added advantage of allowing
this to happen if only parts of a "subclass" are
inherited. It is easier to get away from the tree
organization of subclassing. In casing you can pick and
choose in more of a set-oriented fashion. OO requires
loading up the top parent class in order to do this.
</small></blockquote>

Here is an illustration of single-level and multi-level
inheritance equivalency:
<pre>
  sub mySample(rs)
    select rs.type     // field "type"
    case RECTANGLE
       blah...
    case CIRCLE
       blah...
    case POLYGON
       blah...
    case TRAPEZOID, POLYGOID, HYPERGOID   // multi-layer inher. equiv.
       blah...
    case else
       blah...     // default (parent) code
    endSelect
  endSub
</pre>
This example is roughly based on Visual Basic case syntax, which
does allow multiple items per case block.
<p>
Note that if most of the implementation code is shared per
routine, or the differences not "even" from variation to
variation, then
case statements may no longer be recommended. See
<a href="boundary.htm">Change Boundaries</a> for more
on this.
<p>
See the
<a href="inher.htm">Inheritance Compared</a> document
for illustrative and quantitative code examples regarding
case statements and inheritance.

<blockquote><small>
Same have claimed that OOP can potentially check for
missing method implementations at <b>compile-time</b>. However,
this assumes that you are never going to use
the parent's implementation. In other words, for
compile-time checking to work, you either have
to decide to override every "enforced" method,
or always use just the parent's. This prevents
selective-inheritance, which is supposed to be
one of the selling points of OOP inheritance.
I agree that in some cases this might be useful,
but only in very limited circumstances.
</small></blockquote>


<a name="dispatch"></a>
<h3> Dispatching </h3>

Are case statements larger because the dispatching (selection setup)
has to be done at the top of each case statement, plus
a function parameter?
<p>
It seems that OO does save on dispatching code, but takes
up more code in defining the parent class. Procedural/relational
programming does not (usually) have the equivalent of this in
the form of a "parent case" structure. Thus, as far as code
size, it is generally a wash. (See
<a href="inher.htm">Inheritance Compared</a>.)
<p>
Some also claim that the "manual" dispatch makes case statements
more error-prone. My experience is that it does not, simply because
case statements that repeat the case list in multiple routines
are generally rare. This "textbook case" pattern is mostly a
figment of OO books (or bad proceduralists).
<p>
Further, the OO approach can have problems in declarations,
such as assigning the wrong subclass to a given instance.
(Although the ratio of usage to declaration is admittedly
generally higher.)

<p>
If such a case pattern was more frequent, then dispatch protection
perhaps would approach something to look into further.

<a name="attributes"></a>
<h3> Types Versus Attributes </h3>

The real world often blurs the distinction between
"type" and attribute. "Type" assumes that <b>one</b> attribute has
domination over other attributes, which is often a bad
assumption in the long run.
<p>
Even the toy shape examples
can fall under this. Somebody suggested
that a "smoothing factor" be added to shape instance
records/objects. An ellipse can then be nothing more than a rectangle
with a 100 percent smoothing factor. The "type" distinction
is then blurred and messy. What "type" is a rectangle with a
90 percent smoothing factor?. This "attribute view" instead
of the type view reflects the real world more accurately
and is more flexible IMO.
<p>
<div align=center>
  Look at the wonderful variety and flexibility
  <br>
  you can <b>miss</b> if you get type-happy
  <br>
  <img src="smooth.gif" alt="morphing shapes">
</div>
<p>


  I keep finding instances of "in between" situations.
  For example, I have been making the distinction
  between "temporary" and "permanent" files for many
  years. However, I have grown to realize that what
  I really need is a "disposition" attribute. A
  disposition attribute indicates how long for the
  system to "keep" the file. A typical "temp" file
  may have a disposition setting of 12 hours, for
  example. However, some files I may want to keep
  for just a month, or a year. If the file system
  supported this, then many files on my system
  would clean up themselves more or less. For example,
  a resume that is customized to a particular
  company probably has a useful life of a few
  months. Five years from now it would be of no
  use because my skills and experience will change
  (unless my OO-bashing gets me black-listed :-)


Further, the
<a href="aspects.htm#barchart">importance of attributes</a>
can change over time.
If somebody turns one attribute into a type and makes subclasses
based on it, what if that attribute then falls out of importance?
The subclasses then become a ball and chain that no longer
reflect anything significant about the instance.
<p>
To get an idea of the interchangability,
think about a fulltime/parttime flag in an Employee
class or table. One could (ill)conceivably make 2 subclasses
instead called Parttime and Fulltime:
<pre>
class Parttime extends Employee {....}   // Java-like syntax

class Fulltime extends Employee {....}
</pre>

In regards to the applicability of shapes to <b>real world</b>
problems, the rules of Geometry are generally immutable (timeless)
and shape properties well documented. However, the business
world is much more unpredictable and dynamic.
<p>
One can state with confidence that no rectangles will ever
have a radius. However, most analogous rules in the business
world are generally <b>subject to change</b>.
<p>
<i>"All
<a href="bank.htm">bank accounts</a>
must either be savings or checking, but not both."
</i>
<p>
If this is a current rule, it could change over
night. New civic laws, or a Grand Marketing Gimmick
could allow BOTH.
<p>
Suppose an OO designer splits "real estate" into two
types: "land" and "buildings". What then is a peice
of land with a small kiosk on it? Land? Building?
Both? Even if there is a strict legal definition that
distinguishes for the time being,
laws are being changed all the time.
<p>
In software engineering terms, one is often called an
"is-a" relationship, and the other is called
a "has-a" relationship. "Has-a" can more or less
be translated as, "has an attribute or feature."
<p>
I contend that to mistake an is-a relationship for
a has-a relationship is safer than the other way
around. The "collection of attributes" view (has-a)
simply "bends" better with change. Types have to be
mutually exclusive by definition. However, attributes
can toggle between mutually exclusive and complementary
with relatively minor code changes.


Note that restrictions on combinations of
attribute values can be enforced via RDBMS
rules and "triggers." For example, a global rule
can be applied to a Shapes table in the form of:
"Reject update if type='rectangle' and radius <> Null".


See <a href="subtypes.htm">Subtype Proliferation Myth</a>
for more about this and other problems with the "type" view.


<p>
<a name="newfield"></a>
<h3> New and Empty Fields </h3>

Some have complained that the procedural/table version
requires every new field to be propagated to all
shape "types", and that empty fields waste space.
<p>
This depends highly on the table/DB engine being
used. In many DB engines, unused fields are simply
not populated per record. Only the schema (field list)
needs to know about any new or unused fields. See
<a href="cntrl1.htm#waste">Control Table Notes</a>
for more about this.

<p>
&nbsp;
<br>
<a name="summary"></a>
<h3> Summary </h3>

The OOP approach compared with the procedural/relational
approach is not less code and has no clear proximity (grouping)
advantage nor an overall change-point quantity advantage.
It also highlights a big difference
between OOP and common, real world needs. OOP 
often assumes that data is born and dies in memory
or in an OODBMS, which is simply not the
case in the overall
<a href="oopbad.htm#model">
real world.</a> It also may artificially elevate some
attributes over others (calling them "type" indicators).
<p>
I am afraid that the OOP shape examples fail to demonstrate
any clear superiority of OOP for typical business programming.

***************************************
*

* - This uses a table called "Shapes" with the following
*   structure:
*
*      ShapeType - Char(3)
*      X, Y, Width, Height, Radius - all Numeric
*
* - I wish Xbase allowed "t.fieldx" to make it easier to

*   be better organization for larger programs. 
*   Although one can do:
*        &t.->fieldx
*   that is a bit awkward, especially for this
*   example. Some dialects do have slightly better shortcuts;
*   but, we are striving to be generic and therefore using

*   See the "L" code example (link below) for a 
*   cleaner approach.
*
*
* - I did not include the SetRadius and similar
*   rectangle operations because it is so trivial
*   to assign a value to a field that making a new
*   function/method just to assign a field results in
*   unnecessary code bloat, especially with tables
*   that have several dozens of fields. If one wants
*   protection or validation, then RDBMS triggers 
*   are usually used for such purposes.
* 
* - We shortened the name of "DoSomethingWithShape"
*   because some older dialects may not like longer
*   names.
*
* - There are some dialect-specific shortcuts that we
*   could have taken to make the code shorter; however
*   we are trying to be as generic as possible here.
*
* - This example assumes integers only. Xbase is admittedly 
*   awkward for floating point work, other than
*   things like currency.
*
* - XBase case statements are not very elegant compared to
*   other languages.
