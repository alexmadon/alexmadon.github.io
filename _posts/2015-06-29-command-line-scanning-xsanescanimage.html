<pre>command line scanning

sane-find-scanner

  # sane-find-scanner will now attempt to detect your scanner. If the
  # result is different from what you expected, first make sure your
  # scanner is powered up and properly connected to your computer.

  # No SCSI scanners found. If you expected something different, make sure that
  # you have loaded a kernel SCSI driver for your SCSI adapter.

found USB scanner (vendor=0x04b8 [EPSON], product=0x0110 [EPSON Scanner]) at libusb:003:014

MAY NEED XSANE to dectect

/dev/bus/usb/003/014
scanimage -d epson2:libusb:003:019 > 001.pnm
or simpler
scanimage -d epson2 > 002.pnm
