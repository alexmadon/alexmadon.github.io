3.1.3 Higher order functions on lists
Functions can be made more flexible by giving them a function as a parameter. A lot of functions
on lists have a function as an parameter. Therefore they are higher order functions.
<h4>map, filter and foldr</h4>
Previously map, filter and foldr were discussed. These function do something, depending on
their function parameter, with every element of a list.

<br/>

The function <b>map</b> applies its function
parameter to each element of the list:
<pre>
           xs = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
                  |   |   |   |    |
map square xs = [ 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 , 25 ]
</pre>
The <b>filter</b> function eliminates elements from a list that do not satisfy a certain Boolean predicate:
<pre>
            xs = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
                   ×   |   ×   |   ×
filter even xs = [     2 ,     4     ]
</pre>
The <b>foldr</b> function inserts an operator between all elements of a list starting at the right hand
with a given value:
<pre>
            xs = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
foldr (+) 0 xs = (1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + (5 + 0 )))))
</pre>

<hr/>

These three standard functions are defined recursively in the prelude. They were discussed earlier
in section 2.3.1. page 26
<pre>
map :: (a->b) -> [a] -> [b]
map f [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs

filter :: (a->Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter p [] = []
filter p (x:xs)
       | p x = x : filter p xs
       | otherwise = filter p xs

foldr :: (a->b->b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr op e [] = e
foldr op e (x:xs) = x ‘op‘ foldr op e xs
</pre>
By using these standard functions extensively the recursion in other functions can be hidden
