The ARAGON Caprice 49 Multifunction A106BLU is a special quartz watch. Under the hood you will find the Japanese SII VH68 movement. This is an exceptional movement for a multitude of reasons. To start it has a separate hand for the day (10 o'clock), date (2 o'clock) and 24 hour (6 o'clock). That aside the watch has a sweeping main second hand. This is rare for a quartz watch - normally the second hand ticks once every second, while the VH68 ticks several times per second, just like a mechanical watch. Despite the watch having several complications and the sweeping second hand, it still runs approximately 2 years on a normal battery.
The A106BLU is a stylish, special watch, with a very nice matching strap. The best part is of course the very good price, that makes this a very nice addition to your collection!.
