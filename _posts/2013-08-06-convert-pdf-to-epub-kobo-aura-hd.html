We know you don't like Calibre... but have you tried it's CLI conversion tool?<br />
<br />
The Calbire install provides the command "ebook-convert" that will handle what you want, and there's no need to run Calibre.<br />
<br />
ebook-convert file.pdf file.epub<br />
<br />
is all that's required.<br />
<br />
If the output looks a little wrong - try this<br />
<br />
ebook-convert file.pdf file.epub --enable-heuristics<br />
<br />
It will try a "smart" way to convert. Not perfect, but can work well in most conversions.<br />
