Recipe: Pine Tarts
Probably my most favourite Guyanese pastry - everybody makes them a little bit different, but they're all tasty!!

Ingredients
<ul>
<li>2 cans crushed pineapple
<li>Sugar (depends on how sweet you want the tarts)
<li>1 large egg
</ul>
Pastry
<ul>
<li>1 lb (16 oz) flour
<li>½ lb (8 oz) of Crisco shortening
</ul>
Preparation
<ul>
    <li> Drain most of the liquid from the pineapple in the cans, then empty the cans into a pot. Add sugar till the sweetness is desired to your taste.
    <li> Boil the pineapple on a medium fire until the juice is absorbed but the fruit is not dry. Stir often to avoid burning. Put aside to cool.
    <li> Prepare the pastry: mix the flour and shortening together until the mixture becomes crumbly like bread crumbs.
    <li> Then, as you mix with your hands, add small amounts of ice cold water as needed, and knead until the flour mixture becomes soft and doughy.
    <li> Break off 1½ inch balls and roll out into thin rounds.
    <li> Put an amount of the pineapple mixture in the center of each round, and then close the pastry over the filling to form a triangle-shaped tart. Use a fork to pinch the corners shut.
    <li> Beat the egg in a bowl and brush it on top of the pine tarts.
    <li> Put the tarts in an oven preheated to 350°F, and bake for 20 - 25 minutes or until done. 
</ul>

Sweet Pine Tarts

July 29, 2009 in Dessert | 10 comments

When I think of pastries, I usually think of this trio: Cheese roll, Beef Patty and Pine Tarts.  These were the pastries I was familiar with as a child, now I have to include puff pastry, choux pastry and the myriad of pastries.  But these three are very dear to me and will always be my favorites.   In the Culinary world pastry is a dough that is filled, stuffed, or topped with other ingredients.  In Guyana our pastry is not the dough itself, but the dish that’s made of pastry(if that makes any sense at all).   Pine Tarts are a perfectly balanced sweet pineapple filling thats tucked away in flaky shortcrust pastry (this is not the Asian cookies pineapple tarts, just to clear up any confusion you might be having at this very moment).  I’ve always loved these but was never satified with the store bought ones, so I decided to venture out and make my own.  It’s beyond comparison…freshly baked homemade Pine Tarts are worth going the extra mile! 

Pineapple Filling:
<ul>
<li>1 20 oz can pineapple chunks
<li>3/4 cup granulated sugar
<li>1 tbsp lemon juice
<li>pinch salt
</ul>



Egg Wash:
<ul>
<li>1 egg yolk
<li>1 tbsp water
</ul>



Pastry:
<ul>
<li>4 cups flour
<li>1 1/3  cup margarine
<li>6 tbsp water
</ul>


Makes 12 pine tarts

Blend Pineapple chunks in blender with 1/2 of juice from can.  Mix blended pineapple, sugar, lemon juice and salt. On a medium fire, cook pineapple for 25 mins until it has thickened.  Do not overcook !!  Remove from heat and cool before using.

Beat one egg yolk with 1 tbsp of water and set aside.

Roll pastry to about 1/8 of an inch thick and cut into 6 inch circles( I used a bowl). a11 Place a 1 1/2 tbsp of pineapple filling in the center of the pastry and spread, leaving 1/2 inch border.  Brush the border with the egg wash.  a2Fold one corner of the pastry over the filling like an envelope. a3 Fold other corner, slightly overlapping.  a4Now fold the last corner of the pastry, this should enclose the filling and form a triangle.  Pinch the edges close. Brush Pastry with egg wash.  pinetart21Bake in a oven preheated to 350 degrees for 15 mins or until golden brown.

Nobody can beat Vedo at making these, so when in doubt call her in New York! She sometimes uses boxed pie crust mix for a quick and easy way of getting them done for guests. You can also use canned, crushed pineapples- but boil with sugar, cinnamon, and juice until it’s the right consistency.

Pastry:
<ul>
    <li> 2 cups all-purpose plain flour
    <li> pinch of salt
    <li> 1 tbsp superfine (caster) sugar
    <li> ½ cup margarine or shortening
    <li> ~4 tbsp ice water
</ul>
Filling:
<ul>
    <li> 8 oz fresh pineapple chunks
    <li> ½ water
    <li> ½ cup sugar
    <li> 1 inch cinnamon stick
    <li> 1 tsp lime juice
</ul>
Directions:
For Pastry:
Combine flour, salt, and sugar in a mixing bowl. Cut in margarine until mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, lifting the flour as you do to trap air into the mixture. Add cold water by the tablespoon just until dough holds together, using a blunt knife to stir. Let pastry dough rest in the refrigerator while preparing the filling.

For filling:
Puree pineapple in food processor or blender. Transfer to saucepan with water, sugar, cinnamon stick, and lime juice. Bring to a boil. When boiling reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until mixture thickens to jam-like consistency. Let cool thoroughly (heat will affect pastry). Remove the cinnamon stick.

Preheat oven to 400 °F (200 °C/Gas 6). Roll out pastry on floured surface to an eighth to a quarter inch thickness. Cut into 4-inch squares and place 2 to 3 teaspoons of pineapple mixture in the middle of each. Wet edges with a few drops of water and fold pastry over to make a triangle; press edges together to seal. Prick each once with a fork.

Arrange on a greased baking sheet and bake until golden- 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool before serving.
