Passover Chocolate Sponge Cake
By: Barbara  
<br>
"This cake <b>uses ground almonds to replace the wheat flour</b> usually found in cakes. When preparing the almonds, a hand grinder is preferable to a food processor or blender because electric machines bring out the oil in nuts. If a blender or food processor is used, grate only 1/2 cup at a time. Do not pack down when measuring."
